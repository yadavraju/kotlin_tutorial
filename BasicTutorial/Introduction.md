## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language for modern multi-platform applications.  Kotlin was developed by `JetBrains`, a company acclaimed for developing tools for professionals. The foremost goal of Kotlin is to provide a concise, productive, and safer alternative to Java. The most common areas to use Kotlin are

1.  Building server-side code
2.  Building mobile applications that run on Android devices

## History of Kotlin

*   Kotlin is relatively a new statically-typed language by 2017, developed by JetBrains. Kotlin is targeted to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Kotlin addresses most of the redundancies present in Java programming language, and also new features have been added that could make application development faster and easier.
*   There are other new languages with new features that could run on JVM, but Kotlin excels in the reduced compile time (comparable to the time taken by Java Compiler) when compared to other languages.
*   Also, Kotlin is concise and expressive while maintaining good compatibility with the existing Java stack. And Kotlin could be written alongside Java or we could convert existing Java classes to Kotlin files or classes using IntelliJ IDEA. All these features make it easy for a Java developer to get started with Kotlin quickly.
*   That being said, the first stable version of Kotlin, Kotlin 1.0 has been released on 15th, Feb 2016. JetBrains would provide backward compatibility for Kotlin 1.0 for a long time. Also, Google added Kotlin as an officially supported language for Android Application development, which is available from Android Studio 3.0.

## Where is Kotlin Now?

Many companies like Corda, Uber, Trello, Pinterest, and Evernote are using Kotlin along with other programming languages to create applications.  In the Google I/O held on 17 May 2017, the Android team announced Kotlin as an official language for Android app development.

Lines of Kotlin code increased from 2.1 million to 10 million in an interval of the year from 2016 to 2017.  Statistics show that approximately 160,000 users have already tried Kotlin.
